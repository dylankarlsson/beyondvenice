Throughout its history, Beyond Baroque has undergone changes along with the city of Venice. As influxes of real estate interest and capital have terraformed Venice’s neighborhoods, so too have communities of writers and artists remained in flux. Its first location was on West Washington Boulevard, described as a derelict stretch for down-and-out artists and crime, it was remodeled and rebranded in the 80s as Abbot Kinney Boulevard (named after Venice’s prime investor and millionaire founder). Now, Abbot Kinney is the city’s center for tourism and luxury shopping, while Beyond Baroque inhabits Venice’s old City Hall building. Abbott Kinney symbolizes a shift in the construction of Venice as a city, as it has homogenized the space and in doing so pushed out many of the previous inhabitants, many lower-income and working-class Black and Latino folks. As Venice began changing its image and structure, Beyond Baroque made the shift from outsider artist space to public arts institution, in a move that kept it alive as a community space. This shift is reflective of Beyond Baroque’s nonprofit status, a designation that was vital for the emerging literary center. By moving to a nonprofit status there was more potential for varied flows of federal, state, and local funding than there was formerly, though there were also tradeoffs in independence from outside stakeholders. But perhaps most important to this new infrastructure was the discounted postal rates, which allowed for the creation of a distribution network, as George Drury Smith began sending out publications in bulk.

The production of text has been a part of Beyond Baroque since its inception. Here in the archive, the inscription of language is a uniting force, cohering literary connections through tables of contents, mailing lists, and event flyers. The text left behind in the archive performs the relationships that formed organically through the poets, artists, and their mutual interest. Not without its absences and confusions in meaning, text is also performative in the sense that it can often fail. Though the archive will not show us everything, it can point towards the abundance of connections and effort that went into fostering and maintaining a space for community, poetry and art amidst the backdrop of a city that was rapidly gentrifying, defunding public housing, and economically re-structuring. By looking through the archive, we can see how a community’s history is crafted through this text.
