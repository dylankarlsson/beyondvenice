Throughout its history, Beyond Baroque has undergone changes along with the city of Venice. As influxes of real estate interest and capital have terraformed Venice’s neighborhoods, so too have communities of writers and artists remained in flux. Its first location was on West Washington Boulevard, described as a derelict stretch for down-and-out artists and crime, it was remodeled and rebranded in the 80s as Abbot Kinney Boulevard (named after Venice’s prime investor and millionaire founder). Now, Abbot Kinney is the city’s center for tourism and luxury shopping, while Beyond Baroque inhabits Venice’s old City Hall building. Herein lies the symbolic shift from outsider artist space to public arts institution. This shift is reflective of Beyond Baroque’s nonprofit status, a designation that was vital to creating a distribution network for publications as a result of discounted postage rates. By moving to a nonprofit status there was more potential for varied flows of federal, state, and local funding than there was formerly, though there were also tradeoffs in independence from outside stakeholders.
