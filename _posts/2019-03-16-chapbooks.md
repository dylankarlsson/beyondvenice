 Beyond Baroque houses a comprehensive collection of over 40,000 volumes of “rare small and independent presses, self-published writers' chapbooks, rare avant-garde and hand-printed literary periodicals, broadsides, and anthologies, with a specialization in post-‘68 work.” The collection materials span from 1937 to 2005. A simple, inventoried dataset was previously hosted online with over 3,200 records of the collection represented. The bulk of its material is represented in the acceleration of collection after 1968, with a clear peak in 1976. The collection dips and stagnates around 1984 to 1988, a period of funding issues that may have affected the collecting power of the chapbook archive. It is not clear how these materials were collected, though for many years Beyond Baroque had a position for an on-site librarian.
